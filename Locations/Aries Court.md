room below the [[Chess Room]] with 8 statues of kings with [[Mora Jai Boxes]]

```
IN ARIES COURT WHERE THE KING NOW LAYS,
ON THE SACRED HOUR THAT TIMEWORN PHRASE
WILL A YOUTH APPROACH WITH EMPTY ARMS
WITHOUT GIFTS NOR GOLD NOR MANNERED CHARMS
AND IN SKY ABOVE A BRILLIANT SIGN:
A SULLEN CROSS AS FIVE STARS ALIGN.
A PATIENT FIGURE, A RECKONING GREAT.
THE BLACK KEY IS LYING WITH THE LAST KING OF EIGHT.
