Tomorrow your future is without me. Tomorrow my future is without you.

Tomorrow you and I will be parted.
We may never see each other again.
You are a princess.
You are a descendent of *Od*.
You are high-born.
Forget your Northern dreams.
Forget what those Northerners tell you.
You will always be my daughter.
You should go South from Fenn.
Away from your so-called parents.
You should go away from Fenn. Away from your father's plans.
Make your future in the South, in Eraja.
Seek your destiny in the South, in Eraja.

> To my first child,
> 
> You are my day, you are my night, you are my world.
> To you I gift my house in the South.
> You and I may go our separate ways.
> But I bid you heed my words: You are a child of *Od*.
> You are not a Sinclair. You are not an Epsen.
> Forget what those Northerners think.
> Your name is Je Ari.
> You should go away from Fenn. Away from your father's plans.
> Start a new life in the South, in Eraja.
> 
> Goodbye my daughter,
> Your Mother
