a hint in [[Her Ladyship's Diary]] suggests drafting the [[Antechamber]] as an [[Outer Room]]

when you do so, a note found in the [[Shrine]] says:

> Steady is the [[Scepter]]
> Deadly is the [[Cursed Stone Idol|Stone]]
> Heavy is the [[Crown of the Blue Prince|Crown]]
> Ready is the [[Throne Room|Throne]]
> (drawing of the [[Cursed Coffers]])
