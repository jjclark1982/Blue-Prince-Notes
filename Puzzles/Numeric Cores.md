- Take any number with four or more digits. Without changing the sequence, split the numbe into four smaller numbers. (ex. `86455` becomes `8` `6` `45` `5`)
- Next, assign each a different color, resulting in a valid mathematical equation. The first number should always be assigned teal to begin with a positive number. (ex. $+$ `8` $-$ `6` $\times$ `45` $÷$ `5`)
- If the result is a number with more than three digits, repeat the above process. The final number you obtain that is less than four digits is considered the “numeric core” of the larger number. (ex. 18)
