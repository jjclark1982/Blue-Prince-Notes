Add a word to Spiral of Stars, then gain one [[Keys|key]] and one [[Gems|gem]] for each [[Rank]] reached, then lose three [[Steps]] for each [[Rank]] reached, then gain one [[Coins|coin]] for each [[Days|day]] spent, and then lose two [[Stars]]. If you have less than forty [[Steps]], gain one random item from the [[Showroom]]. If you have less than twenty [[Steps]], open all [[Antechamber]] doors, then set your [[Steps]] to forty.

Also, your [[Luck]] has been increased and you can no longer gain [[Steps]] or [[Gems]] or [[Keys]] or [[Coins|gold]] and your day will immediately end if you ever attempt to add another word to [[Spiral of Stars]].
